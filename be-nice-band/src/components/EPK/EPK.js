            BE N!CE are a London-based band colliding harsh flavours of punk
            with post-punk, hardcore, grunge & alternative metal influences,
            towing the line between writing about important personal & social
            issues whilst not taking themselves too seriously.

            The band have carved out their own style in the alternative scene,
            using colour & fun to push back against a bleak social climate,
            having begun like most punk bands wanting to release pent up
            frustration. Their songs cover a variety of topics ranging from
            mental health, social injustice, sexual harassment and being sleepy,
            made distinct through each memberâ€™s own unique musical contribution
            thanks to a wide range of influences while having overtones of
            Bikini Kill, The Oozes and Witch Fever.
