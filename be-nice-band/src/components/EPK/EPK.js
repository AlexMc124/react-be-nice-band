              BE N!CE are a London-based band colliding harsh flavours of punk
              with post-punk, hardcore, grunge & alternative metal influences,
              towing the line between writing about important personal & social
              issues whilst not taking themselves too seriously. 
            </div>
            <div class="text-left indent-2 p-2 text-base/7">
            The band have
              carved out their own style in the alternative scene, using colour
              & fun to push back against a bleak social climate, having begun
              like most punk bands wanting to release pent up frustration. Their
              songs cover a variety of topics ranging from mental health, social
              injustice, sexual harassment and being sleepy, made distinct
              through each memberâ€™s own unique musical contribution thanks to a
              wide range of influences while having overtones of Bikini Kill,
              The Oozes and Witch Fever. In their first year, the band made
              their mark in the DIY London-scene and grew a small but loyal
              following. They intend to make 2024 the year of BE N!CE.
